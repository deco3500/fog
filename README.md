## Introduction ##

Current social media is filled with pictures of food and recommendations with no direction or organisation, our aim is to move this content to a dedicated service. Foodle is a social mobile application that merges food and friends, while tailoring the content to users wants. Foodle is unique for utilising the user’s location to determine restaurants nearby that they would like. 

## Concept ##

Foodle will merge location technology with a food feed featuring friends, family and celebrities. Users will be able to scroll through the food feed and view images posted by their selected friends, or view the ‘near you’ section. The near you section filters posts from Foodle users and displays the information based on location and preferences. Foodle will learn a user’s preferences based on posts they have expressed interest in, and places they have visited. When a user saves a post, they will be able to find this information in the ‘menu’ section - this will include all images and locations a user has expressed interest in. Users will also be able to search through people, food and places to find any additional information they require. Friends can tag friends in posts they view on the food feed, and tag them in their own image posts. 

The application can be used to connect people with food and friends, wherever they are. Users will be able to log into the app using Facebook, enabling friends and family to easily find each other - allowing users to create their own Foodle community. Foodle aims to simplify finding delicious and convenient food, while simultaneously connecting users. The typical user may include families or individuals who enjoy eating out and discovering and connecting over food. Thus, the target audience will range from young teens, around fifteen, to older users around forty. 

Foodle differs from current food applications as it incorporates social mobile technology with location. Not only are users posting and communicating with their friends, but they are provided with relevant and organised food information which relates to their interests and location. Therefore, users are provided with unique and meaningful food information, rather than the usual generic and unrelatable information.  
                        
## Team ##

The team will consist of the following team members:
- Elloise Przybylo - content and back-end development
- Felicia Dubber - content and back-end development
- Aaron Curtis - Front-end development and design
- Samantha Coates - Front-end development and design

Elloise will be taking the role of team leader and will coordinate the work between team members. All team members will be individually responsible for procuring any materials they need to complete the project, as well as transport to the team meetings.

Decisions will be made as a team with the team leader coordinating the team towards a decision that the whole team is content with. Decisions will be made during the weekly meeting or on the team Slack board. All team members are expected to be respectful when organising these decisions and if conflicts arise, team members should be flexible and compromise. If the conflict cannot be resolved, an impartial third-party will be brought in to help mediate.

In the event that a team member isn’t performing up to the team’s standards, the issue will be brought up in the weekly meeting. This will give the team member a chance to discuss with the team on ways they can improve on their performance. The team member will given three warnings before there will be an impact on their peer review for the project.
                        
## Communications ##

Weekly meetings will take place on Fridays at 10am during the DECO3500 workshop and will last for two hours. This workshop is held in the Advanced Engineering Building (49) of UQ in room 316. During this meeting any issues from the past week will be brought up and further work will be organised. If further meetings are needed, they will take place at another time on Tuesdays at 9am. 

Communication will take place over the team Slack channel and Facebook group. Slack was nominated as a team communication platform due to the encouragement for its use in the course. Facebook will also be used as all team members use this platform often. Team members will be expected to keep up to date with team communication daily. To facilitate group project work, a combination of Github and Google Docs will be used. Github will be used for general project work and Google Docs will be used to type up written documents. All project files should be stored in Github. Files will be named using camelcase.            
                        
## Plan ##

- To deliver this project we have spent the past week researching competition and developing the requirements of the app. 
- From here we will start on the design of the app, focusing on functionality.
- Week 7 will be spent on completing the visual design in preparation for paper prototype testing in week 8. We can then present our design and user testing at the stand up in week 8.
- The during rest of week 8 and week 9 we will implement the design developed in earlier weeks, incorporating the results of our user testing. We can then present the finished iteration in the week 10 stand up for review.
- In week 11 we will conduct cognitive walkthrough with a few test subjects from the target audience. 
- We will take results from this cognitive walkthrough and the feedback from the week 10 stand up to further refine the design of our prototype. We can then present the updated prototype at the week 12 stand up.
- We can then make any final changes necessary before submitting in week 13.
